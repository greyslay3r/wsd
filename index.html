			<h2>Here is my review of the VoiceLive Touch</h2>
		</header>
			<p id="review">I have just started using this thing and my mind is blown. <strong>I cannot believe how powerful of a tool it is.</strong> It has taken our show to a new level. It is really easy for live use if you are a singer without an instrument. If you play an instrument you can buy a footswitch. Just remember if you play acoustic, get a sound hole cover and plug in, or the acoustic can cause some interference with the vocal effects. You can spend days looking up info on this thing, and it is worthwhile. I am in love!
There are several buttons on the front. uMod, I dont really use much because I have no need for modulation like effects, but it will be nice if I find a need. The delay works well, but you cannot set how long the feedback is. Definate downfall there, hopefully they will find a firmware fix. The reverb is awesome, several styles, they sound great. I set it and forget it. FX is an area that I have not dove into much, but what I have heard I like. Doubling feature completely rocks, use this one a ton. And the harmonies with a guitar plugged in are absolutely amazing!
There are 225 presets, so when you first get it, you will play with it for hours!
The looper can be daunting for someone who has no experience, however I am starting to figure it out some, and think with practice it will be great. I imagine it would rule for someone who uses loops frequently.
As I find out more, I will update this!</p>
